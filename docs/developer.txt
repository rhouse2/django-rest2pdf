Developer Notes
===============

The app does not have any models and does not use the contrib admin
interface. The key elements of this app are in:

   views.py

      Does the rendering.
      
   templates/template.rst
   
      Specifies the document layout
      
   templatetags/rest2pdf_tags.py
   
      Custom template filter for section headings
      
   styles/pdf.style
   
      A rst2pdf stylesheet to size fonts and define PDF page headings 
      and footers.

The view function that generates the PDF document has a similar
interface to that of `Django generic view
<http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/generic-views/>`_. If you are
already using generic views, this simplifies use.

Performance
-----------

For PDF documents more than 10 or so pages, it would be faster to have
the document pre-produced (e.g. via a cron job) and saved as a file
with the static media.

Testing
-------

rest2pdf contains a tests directory. Running ./runtests.py will create a 
test database containing some FAQ content and generate an example.pdf 
document.
