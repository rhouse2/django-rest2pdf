Quick Start
===========

To generate PDFs from your own project, you need to:

* Include ``rest2pdf`` as an INSTALLED_APP.

  (This isn't essential as the app has no models and therefore doesn't
  affect the database. It just makes it easier to find templates and
  templatetags.)

*  To your project settings.py file, add::

      # List of rst2pdf style sheet paths.
      RST2PDF_STYLESHEET_DIRS = ['proj/rest2pdf/styles',]


*  In your urls.py file, add a parameter dictionary and url conf to
   trigger the view::

      # Keyword argument dictionary for pdf document production
      document_contents_dict = {
          "queryset": Article.objects.filter(date_deleted__isnull=True),
          "template_name": 'template.rst',
          "template_object_name" : "article",
          "style_sheets": ['pdf.style'],
          "extra_context": {
                  "document_date": Article.objects.filter(
                          date_deleted__isnull=True).latest('date_modified').date_modified,
                  "title": "FAQ",
          }
      }
      urlpatterns += patterns('rest2pdf.views',
          url(r'pdf/$', 'rst_to_pdf', document_contents_dict, name='pdf_download'),
      )

Should you need additional variables in your template, include them
within the ``extra_context`` dictionary.


*  Modify the template file (``template.rst``) to suit your own data:

   In the ``rest2pdf/templates`` directory, there is an example
   template for a reStructuredText to PDF document. Copy this file to
   your ``your_project/templates`` directory and modify it to suit the
   model content. If you install rest2pdf as an app within your
   project, then you can modify the template in place.

   rest2pdf has a simple custom template filter ``rst_heading`` to
   mark up section headings in the text. Example usage::

      {{ variable|rst_heading:"=" }}

      results in:

      value of variable
      =================


   Most of the simple reStructuredText markup can be achieved in
   directly in the template, but there are probably some more template
   filters to write to cover reStructuredText more comprehensively.
   Submissions are welcome.
