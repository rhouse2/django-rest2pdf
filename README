Django PDF Creation
===================

http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/howto/outputting-pdf/#howto-outputting-pdf
documents a means of generating PDFs with Django. However, putting text 
on a page takes a lot of coding effort using the ReportLab API directly.

reStructuredText is now the formatting approach behind a lot of Python
documentation and tools (e.g. Sphinx) and a library (rst2pdf) now 
exists to translated reStucturedText to PDF directly, with helpful 
features such as hyperlinked table of contents automatically generated.

This application uses Django templates to generate a reStructuredText 
intermediary file from model content, and then rst2pdf converts that 
text into a pdf file, returning it in an http response object.

The installation requirements and instructions are in the INSTALL file.
See the docs directory for further information.
